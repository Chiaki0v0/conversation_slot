MUL0875.json	16	Vue to Curry. Thank you.
MUL0875.json	17	I apologize for the confusion. Currently, the taxi is set to depart Vue Cinema at 14:45 to go to Curry Garden. Does this need to be changed?
MUL0875.json	18	No. That is what I need. Thank you!
MUL0875.json	19	Great! Thank you for confirming that. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
