MUL1223.json	15	Your very welcome! Enjoy your stay!
SNG1113.json	0	I would like to visit a cinema of the west side.
SNG1113.json	1	I am sorry but I do not have any cinema's on the west side of town, can I check a diffrent location or help find something else for you?
SNG1113.json	2	How about a museum then?
SNG1113.json	3	I have 7 museums in the west of the city, 6 are free entry and one is 3.50. Do you have a preference for a museum or a gallery?
SNG1113.json	4	I would prefer a museum. One with free entry if possible.
SNG1113.json	5	The Museum of Classical Archaeology is lovely, and they have no entrance fee. Would that fit your needs?
SNG1113.json	6	That is fine. Book me a ticket and get me a reference number.
SNG1113.json	7	We don't have the ability to book tickets for the museum from here, but if you'd like to contact them, their phone number is 01223335153. Can I help with anything else?
SNG1113.json	8	That's all, thank you.
SNG1113.json	9	You're welcome. Thank you for using Cambridge TownInfo Centre. Goodbye.
